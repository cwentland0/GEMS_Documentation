# General Equations and Mesh Solver (GEMS) Documentation

This project provides documentation for the theory and operation of the **GEMS** finite volume solver. Simply build the `main.tex` file with your preferred LaTeX compiler.Major sections are split into separate files, which are input through `main.tex`.

If you add capabilities to **GEMS**, please add supporting documentation for any relevant theory, input parameters, and input file formatting.
